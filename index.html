				In Sweden there is a sub-genre for Bimbo's, Fjortis which is almost the same, though they don't like being called <em>bimboes</em>. Their clothes can vary from somewhat <a href="http://www.addidas.com">casual-looking clothes to sporty-adidas shirts</a>, but <strong>they really don't play any sport</strong>.

				Bimbos usually only hang out with each other, and all do the same things together.
